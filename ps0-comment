again, no docx here pls! only dofiles, txt, or worse case scenario pdf; comments:

i like:
What do counties or county-equivalents risk when they declare themselves to be immigration “sanctuaries?”  Does declaring itself a sanctuary jurisdiction open counties and county-equivalents to increased ICE monitoring and/or ICE raids?
you have var about sanctuarity; should be able to measure ICE presence; but theere are confounding vairables like
immigrants and crime; ie it may not be sanctuarity but immigrants and crime that casue ICE, so you want to control for that!
should start getting the data asap and getting your hands dirty with it! per#2 see icpsr, there will be way more data on this
than just gss; exciting topic--looking forward to it!!
